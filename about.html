    <h1>About why I choose this choice of cause</h1>
  <br/>
  <br/>

      
    <p>Reason 1: I live in a trailer with my mother, 3 pets, and 3 siblings, and our rent is pretty expensive even with me and my mother’s paycheck; that’s not even including the basic necessities or emergencies (example: gas, food, and if a light breaks)</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
      
      <p>Reason 2: My community is very poor and so as a result there are few job opportunities, $12.56 is now the minimum wage from jobs here in Colorado but everything keeps rising up in prices.
</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>   
      
      <p>Reason 3: I worry constantly if me and my family will be able to make each day just fine, because food and housing is too expensive and gas as well.</p>
